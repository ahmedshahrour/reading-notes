Controlling sizes of images in CSS :

Specifying image sizes helps
pages to load more smoothly
because the HTML and CSS
code will often load before the
images, and telling the browser
how much space to leave for an
image allows it to render the rest
of the page without waiting for
the image to download.
You might think that your site
is likely to have images of all
different sizes, but a lot of sites
use the same sized image across
many of their pages.

AligNing images Using CSS

There are two ways that
this is commonly achieved:
1: The float property is added
to the class that was created to
represent the size of the image
(such as the small class in our
example).
2: New classes are created with
names such as align-left or
align-right to align the images
to the left or right of the page.
These class names are used in
addition to classes that indicate
the size of the image.

Centering images Using CSS:

Once it has been made into a
block-level element, there are
two common ways in which you
can horizontally center an image:
1: On the containing element,
you can use the text-align
property with a value of center.
2: On the image itself, you can
use the use the margin property
and set the values of the left and
right margins to auto.

Background Images:

The background-image
property allows you to place
an image behind any HTML
element. This could be the entire
page or just part of the page. By
default, a background image will
repeat to fill the entire box.

Repeating Images:

repeat:
The background image is
repeated both horizontally and
vertically (the default way it
is shown if the backgroundrepeat
property isn't used).

repeat-x
The image is repeated
horizontally only (as shown in
the first example on the left).

repeat-y
The image is repeated vertically
only.

no-repeat
The image is only shown once.
The background-attachment
property specifies whether a
background image should stay in
one position or move as the user
scrolls up and down the page. It
can have one of two values:

fixed
The background image stays in
the same position on the page.

scroll
The background image moves
up and down as the user scrolls
up and down the page.

Contrast of background images:

High Contrast:
The majority of photographs
have quite a high contrast, which
means that they are not ideal for
use as a background image.

Low Contrast:
Image editing applications such
as Photoshop and GIMP have
tools that allow you to manually
adjust your images to have lower
contrast.

Screen:
To overlay text on an image with
high contrast, you can place a
semi-transparent background
color (or "screen") behind the
text to improve legibility.

How to Identify Keywords and Phrases:

1: Brainstorm

List down the words that
someone might type into
Google to find your site. Be sure
to include the various topics,
products or services your site is
about.
It often helps to ask other people
what words they would use to
find your site because people
less familiar with a topic might
use different terms than you. (In
particular, they are less likely to
use industry-specific jargon.)
Your list may include some
keyword phrases (not just
individual words) if you have
topics which are described by
more than one word.

2: Organize:

Group the keywords into
separate lists for the different
sections or categories of your
website.
For example, if your website
was a pet shop you might have
different categories for different
animals (such as dogs, cats and
rabbits).
On a large site you may
break this up further into
sub-categories (for example,
separate groups for different pet
food brands).

3: Research:
There are several tools that let
you enter your keywords and
then they will suggest additional
keywords you might like to
consider.

 4: Compare
It is very unlikely that your
site will appear at the top of
the search results for every
keyword. This is especially true
for topics where there is a lot
of competition. The more sites
out there that have already been
optimized for a given keyword,
the harder it will be for you to
rise up the search results when
people search on that term.
Some of the keyword research
sites can tell you how many
people have searched for a
specific keyword to help you
know how much competition
those terms have.

5: Refine
Now you need to pick which
keywords you will focus on.
These should always be the ones
that are most relevant to each
section of your site.
If there is a phrase that is very
relevant but you find there is a
lot of competition, you should
still use it. To improve the
chances of your site being found
you can look at whether there
are other words that could be
incorporated into a phrase. For
example, if the information or
service you offer on your website
is location specific, then you will
often find that incorporating
your location into your keyword
list will help people find you.

6: Map
Now that you have a refined list
of keywords, you know which
have the most competition, and
which ones are most relevant,
it is time to start picking which
keywords you will use for each
page.
Pick 3-5 keywords or phrases
that map to each page of your
website and use these as the
keywords for each page.
