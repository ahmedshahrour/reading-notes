Basic writing and formatting syntax
Create sophisticated formatting for your prose and code on GitHub with simple syntax.


Quoting code
You can call out code or a command within a sentence with single backticks. The text within the backticks will not be formatted.


Links
You can create an inline link by wrapping link text in brackets [ ], and then wrapping the URL in parentheses ( ). You can also use the keyboard shortcut command + k to create a link.

Relative links
You can define relative links and image paths in your rendered files to help readers navigate to other files in your repository.

A relative link is a link that is relative to the current file. For example, if you have a README file in root of your repository, and you have another file in docs/CONTRIBUTING.md

Lists
You can make an unordered list by preceding one or more lines of text with - or *.

- George Washington
- John Adams
- Thomas Jefferson

Nested Lists
You can create a nested list by indenting one or more list items below another item.

To create a nested list using the web editor on GitHub or a text editor that uses a monospaced font, like Atom, you can align your list visually. Type space characters in front of your nested list item, until the list marker character (- or *) lies directly below the first character of the text in the item above it.
