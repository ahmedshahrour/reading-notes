edagogy Vs Andragogy In Practice 
So, how can a thoughtful learning professional address the varied needs of adult and child learners and incorporate both teacher-centered and student-centered practices? The following list provides a few suggestions:

Regardless of the audience’s demographics and background, frame learning in the context in which participants will apply it; make it real.
Provide the WFIM (what’s in it for me) for participants to increase receptivity and cultivate a desire to learn.
Increase engagement by soliciting stories and examples from participants, adults and children alike, which also reinforces the relevance of learning.
Provide options, particularly around application activities, e.g. “Choose from one of the following scenarios”, “Make a final presentation on a topic about which you might speak in real life”, etc.
Use simulations, case studies, labs, on the job training practices, etc. to mimic expectations about what the learners must physically do either on the job, or when they get into “the real world”.
Leverage natural curiosity and drive by building engaging experiences that grab the participants’ attention and prompt them to want to know more.


The Andragogical Model Of Instruction
The development of Andragogy as a different model of instruction helps remedy pedagogical approaches, and improves the teaching of adults. Andragogy derived from the Greeks and essentially means "adult learner". Approximately 30 years ago, Andragogy was designed as a system of ideas, concepts, and approaches to adult learning in the United States by Malcolm Knowles. Malcolm Knowles influenced the thinking of countless educators with dialogue, debate, and subsequent writings related to andragogy. These concepts have served as a stimulant to some of the growth of the adult education field during the past 30 years.


Final Words
This was an amazing experience for me and enabled me to further understand the relationship between Pedagogy and Andragogy as no longer linear with a defined entrance and exit point, but rather as fluid and dynamic and relationship. I, now, understand that based on the cognitive ability and aptitude of the learner, they could easily fall at the beginning, middle, or end of a spectrum of learning. Though this may seem obvious in concept, the key take away is the assumptions we place on learners that can involuntarily disrupt their learning. Yes, my son is ten, however this does not mean he has to functionally learn in a pedagogical model because of age or relevancy to the material. Learners should continuously be assessed to ensure proper instructional strategies are being used. Instructional Design should never be so rigid that it can not be adapted to specific learners.
