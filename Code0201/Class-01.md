Duckett HTML book

Chapter 1 of HTML and CSS by Jon Duckett

Understanding structure
Learning about markup
Tags and elements
We come across all kinds of documents every day of our lives. Newspapers, insurance forms, shop cataloguesâ€¦ the list goes on.

Many web pages act like electronic versions of these documents. For example, newspapers show the same stories in print as they do on websites; you can apply for insurance over the web; and stores have online catalogs and e-commerce facilities.

In all kinds of documents, structure is very important in helping readers to understand the messages you are trying to convey and to navigate around the document. So, in order to learn how to write web pages, it is very important to understand how to structure documents. In this chapter you will:

See how HTML describes the structure of a web page
Learn how tags or elements are added to your document
Write your first web page



Chapter 8 :

Specifying different versions of HTML
Identifying and grouping elements
Comments, meta information and iframes
At this point, we have covered the main tags that fit nicely into groups and sections.

In this chapter, we will focus on some helpful topics that are not easily grouped together. You will learn about:

The different versions of HTML and how to indicate which version you are using
How to add comments to your code
Global attributes, which are attributes that can be used on any element, including the class and id attributes
Elements that are used to group together parts of the page where no other element is suitable
How to embed a page within a page using iframes
How to add information about the web page using the <meta> element
Adding characters such as angled brackets and copyright symbols

Chapter   17 :

HTML5 layout elements
How old browsers understand new elements
Styling HTML5 layout elements with CSS
HTML5 is introducing a new set of elements that help define the structure of a page.

They are covered here (rather than with the other HTML elements you met earlier in the book) because you'll find it easier to understand how they can be used now that you have seen how CSS can control the layout a page. These new elements are going to play an important part in creating layouts going forward. In this chapter you will see:

The new HTML5 layout elements and their uses
How they offer helpful alternatives to the <div> element
How to ensure older browsers recognize these elements

How to understand the audience your site may attract and what information they will expect to find on it
